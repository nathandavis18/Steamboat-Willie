<p> Steamboat Willie Scheduler's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

<br />
<h5>How Steamboat Willie Scheduler uses your Google User Data (if granted access)</h5>
<hr />
<p>This application requests permission to view your Name, email, preferred language, and your profile picture. You can also optionally grant access to your Google Calendar Events.</p>
<p>By granting access to your Google Calendar Events, you allow this application to view, edit, create, and delete your events. The purpose for this access is to allow automated integration
    between your Steamboat Willie Scheduler account and your Google Calendar, adding the newly registered appointments to your calendar, and removing any canceled appointments from your calendar.</p>

<br />
<h5>How we store your data</h5>
<hr />
<p>This application only stores your email, name, and phone number. Your calendar information is never stored, and is only accessed upon creation/deletion of an event.</p>
<p>This is to ensure our users' data is protected. We access this data through a stored unique refresh token, which in conjunction with this application's unique client ID and your account's unique user ID, requests
    access to your calendar. Upon successful authentication, the calendar event is then created/deleted, and the access token is discarded, not to be used again.</p>

<br />
<h5>How we share your data</h5>
<hr />
<p>Steamboat Willie Scheduler only shares your data with Weber State University, for non-commercial use and training-purposes only. The only information shared is the information stored in
    our database, which includes your name, email, and phone number.</p>
